/*Design, develop, and execute a program in C++ based on the following requirements: 
An EMPLOYEE class is to contain the following data members and member functions: 
Data members: Employee_Number (an integer), Employee_Name (a string of characters), 
Basic_Salary (an integer) , All_Allowances(an integer), IT (an integer), Net_Salary (an integer). 
Member functions: to read the data of an employee, to calculate Net_Salary and to print the values of all the data members. 
(All_Allowances = 123% of Basic; Income Tax (IT) = 30% of the gross salary (= basic_Salary _ All_Allowance); 
Net_Salary = Basic_Salary + All_Allowances ï¿½ IT)
